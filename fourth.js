// Over the course of this assignment you are going to put 
// together a function which uses constructors and user input 
// to create and manage a team of players.

// Start out by creating a constructor function called “Player” 
// with the following properties and methods...

// Player name: Property which contains the player’s name
// Position: Property which holds the player’s position
// Offense: Property which is a value between 1 and 10 to show 
// how good this player is on offense
// Defense: Property which is a value between 1 and 10 
// to show how good this player is on defense
// GoodGame: Method which increases either the player’s offense 
// or defense property based upon a coinflip.
// BadGame: Method which decreases either the player’s 
// offense or defense property based upon a coinflip.
// PrintStats: Method which prints all of the player’s 
// properties to the screen
// Now create a program which allows you to create 8 unique 
// players; 5 starters and 3 subs.

// Once all of the players have been created, print their stats.

// Once your code is functioning properly, move on to create 
// a function called “playGame” which will be run once all 
// of your players have been created and will do the following...

// Loops 10 times
// Each time the function loops, two random numbers 
// between 1 and 50 are rolled and compared against 
// your starter’s offensive and defensive stats
// If the first number is lower than the sum of your team’s 
// offensive stat, add one point to your team’s score.
// If the second number is higher than the sum of your team’s 
// defensive stat, remove one point from your team’s score.
// After the score has been changed, you may choose 
// to substitute any of your players within the starters 
// array with any of those players within the subs array.
// If your score is positive after the game has finished, 
// run goodGame() for all of those players currently within 
// the starters array. If your score is negative after 
// the game has finished, run badGame() for all of 
// those players currently within your starters array. 
// If the score is equal to zero, then do nothing.
// Prompts the player if they would like to play again: 
// runs playGame from the start once more if they 
// do and ends the program if they don’t.

// HINT: Remember to use recursion when looping 
// with inquirer! Otherwise your program might not 
// return the prompts as you expect.

// HINT: It has been a while since we have worked 
// with random numbers explicitly. If you are having troubles, 
// look up Math.random on Google and you should find some resources to help.
